Three js advanced by bruno simon

PART 1
what is three.js?
js api
renders triangles per pixel for rendering 
canvas 
uses gpu
points are used and positioned eg: vertices of a cube is positioned and joined to get a cube

what is shaders?
the instructions to place the points and draw the pixels are written in shaders

how to move objects?
position,rotaion, scale

What is euler and how to use it?
Euler is easy to understand but this asix order can be problematic, this is why most engines and 3D softwares use Quaternion
when you update rotation it will update Quaternion

camera lookAt property?
camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(...)) or can add mesh.position to make it look at it

what is scene graph?
we can use group to give the multiple objects properties like position rotaion etc

how to configure animation?
we can use THREE.clock.getElapsedTime to make the animation to adjust animation to fps instead of date.now()
we can use gsap for animations

CAMERAS
-Array camera
it render the scene from multiple cameras on specific areas of render ,eg: multiplier games on same screen
-camera
this a abstract parent class cannot be used directly
-stereo camera
it render the scene through two cameras that mimic the eyes to create a parallax effect
uses with devices like vr headset,red and blue glasses or cardboard
-cube camera
it does 6 renders, each one facing a different direction can render the surrounding for things like environment map,reflection or shadow map
-orthographic camera
render the scene without perspective
-perspective camera
